It is a minimal alternative to readline and libedit.\n\nLinenoise is written in C code that supports most distributions of the Linux, macOS and BSD operating systems. We compile the library on install so linking should not be a problem and the library is lightwieght (less than 1500 lines of code) so the resulting binary should be small.\n\nAs of `v0.4.0`, UTF-8 support has been added. This means that the cursor won't have problems when writing in languages with non-Roman alphabets or using emoji.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   dependencies:\n     linenoise:\n       github: apainintheneck/crystal-linenoise\n   ```\n\n2. Run `shards install`\n\n## Usage\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"linenoise\"\n\nCOMPLETIONS = [\n  ...\n]\n\n# Enable tab completions.\nLinenoise::Completion.add(COMPLETIONS)\n\n# Enable completion hints to the right of the cursor.\nLinenoise::Completion.enabe_hints!\n\nHISTORY_FILE = \"...\"\n\nLinenoise.load_history(HISTORY_FILE)\n\n# A simple REPL.\nloop do\n  line = Linenoise.prompt(\"> \")\n  break if line.nil?\n\n  # Process line here.\n\n  Linenoise.add_history(line)\n  Linenoise.save_history(HISTORY_FILE)\nend\n```\n\nFor more information look at the files in the `example/` directory and the [documentation website](https://apainintheneck.github.io/crystal-linenoise/).\n\n## Missing Features & Known Bugs\n\nThere is no high-level wrapper around the multiplexing API but the Crystal bindings have been added for it. See `src/lib/lib_linenoise.cr` for more details.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThere are a few other line editing libraries available for Crystal.\n\n- [reply](https://github.com/I3oris/reply)\n- [fancyline](https://github.com/Papierkorb/fancyline)\n- [crystal-readline](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-readline)\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment setup is mostly managed by the Makefile.\n\nOther than that there is the Linenoise extension in `ext/` that can be built with `make extension`. Keep in mind that this also gets installed automatically in a postinstall step when this shard is included as a dependency and `shard install` is run.\n\nInteractive testing is available using the `example/example.cr` program which allows you to check on different line editing features. It can be run with `make example`. The `make specs` command runs the Crystal specs. The `make expect` command runs tests on this example program using an `expect` script so `expect` will need to be installed to run them.\n\nThe `make lint` command checks for linting errors and the `make fix` command fixes them automatically.\n\nThe `crystal docs` command can be used to build the docs locally or you can visit the [documentation website](https://apainintheneck.github.io/crystal-linenoise/) that gets generated automatically by the `.github/workflows/docs.yml` workflow.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
